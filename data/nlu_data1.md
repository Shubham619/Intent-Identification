You click on an exercise and it immediately counts down and starts. No ability to modify screens, or change lap length.    Any suggestions or help available?    Thanks  Stuart.
- My watch battery started draining rapidly after May update. This is really started to be annoying. Each update they fix something and break other stuff. This is started to be a bull*****. The last update they fixed the battery drain and broke the encoding for some languages. This update they screwed the battery again. I don't know what kind of engineering is this?
- My Gear S3 Classic Alarm stopped working for me after the May 20th update. The alam widgets are not working, the message on the watch says loading but never does, it says , &quot;Loading failed tapto reload&quot;, it never does. If you try to add an alarm through the watch app menu's it just freezes or crashed. Please push a update to fix this is an important part of the watch.
- Cannot believe finger sensor wont work with screen protector. So ridiculous!
- I have a lot to b*tch about.  1. I am FORCED to accept the update.   2. The update took TWO entire days , with over a dozen, different updates. That was about a month ago.  3. Yesterday , out of nowhere, it does it again!..165 mb of bull$hit.  4. Doesn't work with themes.  5.I HATE a white screen!...it's too bright.  6.I HATE the idi0tic big, round, spongey looking Mattel -toy graphics. What moron did this? I WANT A NAME AND AN EMAIL ADDRESS.  7. A smartphone is supposed to be a useful tool to streamline my workday. This android update has made my device an obstruction.
- My Galaxy S8 won't connect to Android Auto. When I connect the USB cable it shows my phone is charging but nothing else happens, no USB notifications, or any indication of anything other than a charger being connected.I have enabled USB debugging under developer options and also set default USB configuration to transfer files. I have also tried my partners Galaxy S8 and Android Auto starts up no problem when the USB cable is connected, so the cable and car settings are fine.
- When I lock my phone my data disconnects and I have to toggle airplane mode to get it to come back. I've been searching for a solution but so far nothing has fixed it.
- Yet again, only a couple of days after going through the process of clearing various caches and storage and getting my watch counting steps and floors it decides to stop working
- My watch battery started draining rapidly after May update. This is really started to be annoying. Each update they fix something and break other stuff.
- Whenever I place a call the screen turns off but screen do not turn on automatically when I remove the phone from my face after receiving call and I need to press the power button or finger sensor to turn it on.
- I have a galaxy s8 plus when i receive incoming calls from a contact in my phone book only their number displays  but when i go in my recent calls both their name and number is there  like most people i don't know everyone's phone number so when people are calling me.
- I updated my s9+ to to android pie and now always on display does not come up automatically when i tap on the blank screen. it shows up. but before the update. it used to show up automatically as soon as the phone screen goes dark.  no lighting issue.
- Decreased battery performance. It feels like now we have 2000mah battery instead of 4000mah after the update even during the night. in the idle state there is 6% to 7% battery drain
- limitations of j6 after update. they had not provided digital wellbeing there is a bug in camera shutter lags. capturing photos in night or hdr takes time ram management is worst .charging slows downlag in pie easter egga bug in device carememory.
- I can't stand this new update  it looks terrible and functions horribly the calendar doesn't even do it's job anymore”





 
## intent: idea
- Hi guys      Does anyone know if the Google discover page is coming to the S10 without going directly to the app. I like the idea of having the discover page to the left of my home screen replacing Bixby home. It seems to be on every other android device.     Thanks in advance
- I would like the suggest samsung to but more efforts on battery rather than on features.
- Samsung new mobile is going to launch in june 2nd week. Grab your phones as soon as possible.
- Put more features in mobile.
- Battery should long last not short. Need to fix it.
- In pro mode, there are 4 additions to be made- a) support for RAW capture in pro mode. b) addition of shutter speed option in pro mode. c) increase in iso range. d) histogram in pro mode.
- Dear Samsung, please give a Quick ball like MI mobile for easy handling big screen of your Galaxy A70 mobile.
- hello. i would recommend samsung to implement the scrolling effect animation found in the samsung health app to be implemented on all of their own apps like messaging. settings etc  the animation is very soothing to see and if actually do that then you probably won't require the blue color effect to appear when one scrolls to the top or bottom of the app.
- Since expensive phone, put some additional layer to the screen that is physically impossible to remove so that those of us with kids don't have a mess. Do what it takes to make sure this product won't break on us all after a week.
- It would've been lovely if samsung introduces the recycle bin option in gallery in order to restore back the accidentally deleted images from galler
- Security on s10 is low. i bought a s10 last week and i kept face unlock.  in previous series ther was option of iris scan with face unlock and this option of iris has removed in s10 Now it is opining when i'm sleeping  if someone shows mobile towards me while closing eyes it gets unlock.


 
 
## intent: inquiry
- Hello all I did a quick search and nothing came up. Trying to decide between these 2 tablets. I know there is a lot online about these 2 tablets but thought it best to bring this to the home of the gadgets.    So what would you guys chose between the 2 and what I really need is performance on top of anything else so your views are very much appreciated.
- Hello guys am considering one of these 2 tablets however worried because the 64gb storage will not be enough as I use a lot of apps. Is it possible to transfer apps to sd card with any of these 2 tablets please?
- Hi, could someone explain this option &quot; Favorite media app''to me? Explain a scenario in which this option could be used.
- Hi,  I've one question.  I want that my s10+ keep disable notification content on lock screen and it displays me only when I unlock it using face recognization as an iPhone X/XS/XR/.
- Hello all,   Has there been an update to the notification bar last night? as you can see the right-hand configuration looks different, and what is the third notification in from the right hand side?  Thank.

There's nothing indicating I can claim them in the Samsung Members app.
- Hello guys. Does anybody know if Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 supports hands free from type C plug?

-Is there a way to add slow motion? I was using it so much before,  that I'm thinking of returning the phone because of this .i assumed it was on all new phones from now onwards.




## intent: general
- A link to petition org to have Samsung return Pro Video Mode.
- A Nice and Elegant Sports Watch with a Heart Rate Monitor, Steps counter and Date. What more would you want ? A minor update saw an addition to a battery indicator thus making the watch-face more informative.
- I feel like they sooo want to make the features and so on look like an iPhone's ! Ugh, have some pride won't ya Samsung ? If I wanted an iPhone I wouldn't have bought a Samsung phone in the 1st place ! And I really liked the previous interface, like really ! Now it's all messed up, the icons specially ! They look like they were designed for kids !  But let's talk about the Always on Display feature !! Since I've had the A5 (2017), I now own a A8 (2018), I've been fond of AOD. It's been even better with all the updates, giving us the possibility to customize it even more.  Wanna know what it looks like know ? Utter and absolute *****.  The hour display I used to find super graceful and elegant has not been spared either.  And whose idea was it to color the small icons under the hour display/clock ??  Samsung, I've been a loyal customer of yours for years, don't make turn my back on you now !
- I think the S8 + is far better than the previous series, really amazing. Give support for activities to manage websites from smartphone. Good Job !
- Nice and elegant community samsung is in india now.
- Now google search bar had support for night mode. samsung is already providing dark mode on android p while this feature is supported on android q now google is officially rolling dark mode support for its own apps
- For amoled  display  users use dark mode as much as possible in ui and in apps that you are using to save battery life

- J6 has started getting android 9 globally. This time Samsung is doing insane performance in terms of update.
- Got the band NEW Galaxy s10... its soooo amazing, best phone I could ever have
- I had a s6 before I got my S9 and I must say that so far I really like the S9. I like Samsung products anyway, but this phone is awesome
- Appreciate Samsung bringing back the favorites tab to the front page. Using bookmarks is apart of the internet experience. Keeping it easy for the user is the whole idea.
- finally got the pie update and let me tell, I am completely thrilled with it. The brilliant UI. There's a couple things that I couple complain about but over all absolutely great.
- he indian consumers would emerge as winners in this battle between samsung and xiaomi, this is because if samsung lower prices of new phones
