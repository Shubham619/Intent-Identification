I used this trail so often that I know exactly how far a 5k is. Before the update, my watch tracked the mileage accurately. After the update, my watch does not track the mileage accurately. Every time I run a 5k (3.1 miles), it says that I only ran 2.6 miles. How do I fix this?"
"4","So I have had my gear sport for nearly a year. I usually have my samsung health app set to only count steps on my gear sport because I wear it all the time except when I am showering (that is when I charge it.) All of a sudden, this afternoon it switched to ""all steps"" on its own. Problem is that this makes it double count the steps when I have my phone on me. My gear sport has only 6800 steps on it. But my app says 9700 steps. And I only took my watch off in the shower so the 6800 steps is accurate. When I try to switch the app from ""all steps"" to my wearable device, the gear sport no longer shows up as an option. The only options are ""all steps,"" ""mobile phone,"" or ""gearfit 2."" I haven't used my gearfit 2 for a year. I am a health and wellness coach so I would really like my app to be accurate. How do I fix this?"

Is this fair that the Americans once again get treated better than the rest of the world on pricing or anything else, etc? For those of us that DO buy our phones SIM free, it hurts us right now, for everyone else that is on contract, imagine if your whole contract was $200 cheaper for the whole contract! That means less paid overall and a cheaper monthly contract. Ask you contract provider WHY are we being done over by SAMSUNG? Is the contract provider going to make up the difference, or put pressure on SAMSUNG to reduce their pricing."

I've emptied the ice out and ensured that all the ice is cubed but each time I dispense ice I can hear the blades chopping it up and crushing the ice. I think the selector maybe the thin metal bar that runs the length of the ice tray and sticks into a square hole at the back where there is an inch square shaped fitting. This flicks forward a curved plastic piece that lifts the ice up so the blades can chop it up. I suspect that the selector is stuck. I've checked for ice etc and there's nothing mechanical at the front of the dray, so it must be the square selector thingy at the back of the fridge?"

This is annoying because I like to know what percentage my battery is on without having to swipe the whole bar down. Fast forward, I just upgraded to the s10+ maybe 2 weeks ago and everything was great but as of 2 days ago my status bar has disappeared again.

"154","Hi, I purchased my phone in december 2018, and got my update for Pie when it came out but the Russian version, (probably because the seller imported it from Russia) and im from Croatia. So I updated it in February to Pie but I was getting a message that I need to reset my phone because I switched carriers. So after i reset it, my CSC changed to SEE, and since then i got no software update and no security update, but I found online that Samsung released a few updates since then even for SEE region. Does anyone know what to do and is it a bug or is it normal? Thank you."

What's wrong with my phone? My old J7 2016 didn't have such issues, I don't have that many apps. My heaviest apps are probably games such as Super Mario Run or Animal Crossing but I rarely play them. The last time I played them was probably a month ago. I think something's wrong with my phone and Samsung's Device Care app manages to fix the RAM wasting issues but only for a few seconds. It has never been that bad, what is wrong with my phone? I really don't want my flagship phone to get worn out so fast. It's only been months, I have had this phone since December 2018."

They have no idea what is going on with your software, and they should be the support. Just give the the email of the developers so I can at least talk to someone that knows what is doing, not just saying stuff to make me stop asking. Here is a screen shot it is in Bulgarian, just translate it. Unacceptable. The works thing is that reporting a software issue made them request my device to be sent to a service center?!?! Wow!"

"244","I've had my Tab A since Christmas 2017, and never had much of a problem with it. It's only done this once before, but shutting it down for a while and turning it on again solved it. This time it hasn't. Every single app closes (or tries to, in the case of Autodesk Sketchbook, because it asks if I want to exit first) ten seconds or less after I open it. I can't even Google anything longer than 3 words because my keyboard closes automatically, and Chrome has even gone back multiple pages, and then closed when it gets back to the new tab page. Sliding down to see all my apps does it too. I've literally watched it slide up on it's own not even two seconds after sliding down. According to my settings, everything is up to date, so idk what the heck is going on."

"256","Hello."
"257","Does anyone know where user feedback can be sent to the devs of the actual Good Lock modules, as this seems to be more of a community chat area rather than a development forum?I'd like to request the very obvious (albeit legacy) 'Menu' button as an option currently missing in NavStar - alongside some of the largely useless extra ones that they do provide. I've always had (or created) a physical menu button at the bottom of my phones, located where I can get at it quickly and easily with one hand, and I still have no intention of bowing to Google's trendy Material Design nonsense about Menus really being 'Overflow Lists' floating somewhere around the screen if you can find them.Also, I'd like to see a new module to adjust physical button actions - particularly to use three-button cabled headsets for changing tracks/albums with MEDIA_NEXT and MEDIA_PREVIOUS events (as per many other non-Samsung devices) instead of altering the volume for which I already have perfectly usable buttons on the phone itself. It used to be really easy on my previous Samsung devices to simply edit the Generic.kl keyboard layout file (needs root) but it would be lovely to have a simple (and Pie-friendly) way to do it on my new Galaxy A70.If those two options were available, I finally think I can live with a mobile device without rooting it, which would be a first for me."
"258","OK, so I've decided to sell my S3 Frontier, unless there's a way to solve the insistence on connecting via Bluetooth.Since the latest update to Tizen 3.0 it looks like Samsung have made it more difficult to use without it being connected 24/7 to an Android device via Bluetooth, which begs the question. Why don't they drop Tizen and use Android Wear instead.Prior to the update I could wear the watch and leave the Android phone at home after solving the issue of the nagging Bluetooth connectivity issue. I don't use the Android for anything but managing the Frontier anyway. There's just no way the watch will perform other than like a dumb watch if it isn't connected to Android via Bluetooth. I still want to monitor things like steps etc and connect via Wi-Fi.As soon as the watch is disconnected from the phone via the Galaxy Wearable app within 10 minutes it's nagging to be connected via Bluetotth evey 10 minutes again. This is no good to me at work where we are required to leave our phones switched off in lockers, and it gets a PITA carrying 2 phones around all the time as well.Samsung need to sort this out and give us the option to use the watch without the need for a 24/7 Bluetooth connection."

The fix seems to be to remove the earbuds and put them in the case so they disconnect, start a Mapmyrun session, confirm heart rate is showing in the Mapmyrun app, take the earbuds out of the case, and put them in my ears. If I go in that order audio and heart rate both work. It is as if the audio is sucking up all the Bluetooth bandwidth unless I start Mapmyrun first. Any ideas?"

This would save the trouble of always manually switching when I get home and back to using the network carrier service everyday to save on my Data usage per month in my Mobile carrier network. It seems to me if the security works this way to unlock my phone, then can't my Data Usage work that way as well? Thankyou for taking the time to read this."

"449","After sharing a long and happy life with our 37"" Panasonic TV, he'd turned 9 years of age and so we decided to upgrade the technology, and pass him on to my sister for her bedroom.

"450","I was pretty excited to finally have a decent and updated phone when I got the S9 in September 2018. And it was great at first...maybe a factory reset would even help. But these updates have gone from bad to worse. The icons changed and are not as attractive. The clock is on the left instead of the right. The selfie camera cuts off my head unless I click 2 person mode every single time I open the camera. The phone randomly calls people when I close their text messages. Etc etc etc. I am just over Samsung at this point. Oh and what's the point of a waterproof phone if you have to wait hours and hours for the charger port to dry before charging?? My next phone will be an Apple, I hate to say. Does anyone know if a factory reset would make it back like when I first bought it?"

There are no visible cracks or marks over the camera and I know it is not this as if focuses for a second and then won't any longer. it will only focus on the camera mode with the 2 drops, but in this I cannot zoom and it means I can't do any slo mo videos or use any of the other settings. I have not had this phone long and as a amateur photographer this is quite upsetting."
