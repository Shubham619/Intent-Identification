Ideas:-

1."emergency call
i wonder how many 911 calls have been placed because of the placement of the emergency call button
 well
 i've called them 3 times
    i wisht would move the button so it's not at the bottom where the home button resides and also so close to the key pad
 i do like having it on the screen. but maybe move it to the top in one of the corners
    thanks  laura"
"messagecan we have the feature where you're able to react to a message instead of typing a message about you laughing
 also what about the background feature for the message app i miss having the option to customize my background"

2."[pe/fr] add option to hide front camera by app instead of just giving us blanket option to turn on &quot;hide front camera&quot; which adds black bar to everything and then set apps to use full screen independently. lets us choose hide front camera on apps independently
 i want to keep full screen as default but some games auto to full screen. which can be annoying if camera is blocking something i need to see or click
 would be nice to be able to set that game to hide camera without having it be the default for everything"

3. "new camera mode suggestion
it would be really cool and produce much more professional looking video if there were an &quot;anomorphic&quot; setting in the camera app
 this could be easily done with the s10 series by using the full screen mode and simply cropping the top and bottom"

4. "samsung health
why. oh why has samsung not put a profile blocking option in their health app
 is it too difficult
 this option will be very popular for those who are tired of the spammers
 please include it in the next update samsung
"

5."samsung internet auto close tabsit would be really nice to have an option to auto close tabs on exit in normal mode"

6. "built in sound amplifier suggest to add sound amplifier into cell phonesvery useful for senior citizen hard of hearings"

7. "picking our own color smartphone
i think it would be cool if we could pick our own colors for the next flagships samsung's smartphones and i hope that the galaxy note 10 pro would have my favorite color purple i have always wanted to have a purple samsung smartphone i got the galaxy note 8 when it came out i got mine orchid gray which is the closest for a purple look i was little disappointed that the s9 got lavender purple same with the note 9 i wish it was available for the note 8 at the time but i will be upgrading to the note 10 pro and i'm hoping that there will be a lavender purple 
 samsung don't give up on the lavender purple i think it is a beautiful color"

8. "folder size in one ui one ui has been great  i've got a suggestion which might have been raised by other users previously
    the folder window size when clicked takes up almost the entire screen when opened
 this aligns all the apps within the folder to almost the top of the screen and makes one hand usage impossible
  is there a particular reason for this implementation
"
9. "galaxy s10+ led notification light samsung   where is the led notification light option
 no one wants to find some alternate work around via a 3rd party application
 there is essentially no practical way to know if i have a text. missed call. etc without unlocking my phone
 absurd  ("

11. in pro mode, there are 4 additions to be made- a) support for RAW capture in pro mode. b) addition of shutter speed option in pro mode. c) increase in iso range. d) histogram in pro mode.

12.Dear Samsung, please give a Quick ball like MI mobile for easy handling big screen of your Galaxy A70 mobile.

13. hello. i would recommend samsung to implement the scrolling effect animation found in the samsung health app to be implemented on all of their own apps like messaging. settings etc  the animation is very soothing to see and if actually do that then you probably won't require the blue color effect to appear when one scrolls to the top or bottom of the app


14. Please give the night mode in the new update in samsung j7 prime

15. I want samsung to add a feature in a50 whenever a notification comes the animation should come around the notch 

16. Screen lock button. sir please add tha screen lock button in widgets. this feature is use to good battery performance

25.I have a Samsung Galaxy A70. It is my request to you that in the next software update please increase the ISO limit in the camera more because the photos become more washed out and please give an individual icon of HDR in the camera app to toggle HDR settings and improve the scene optimiser as most of the time it does not recognise the scene and increase the speed of fingerprint recognition. But leaving these improvements the phone is good.

26.Is there any chance that fingerprint sensor would improve in future updates? Present one really **bleep**.

27.Please change the watermark style?Watermark size is little bigger..

28.Dear Samsung, please give a Quick ball like MI mobile for easy handling big screen of your Galaxy A70 mobile. And please improve camera quality and stability. Thanks.

29.Hello people and developer team , I bought the Samsung galaxy a70 this month, but I was disappointed with the camera performance of the phone.Here are suggestions for the improvement of camera quality and performance:1) While using camera there is most of the time, over sharpening of the pictures.(this need to be fixed)2) while in pro mode, there are 4 additions to be made- a) support for RAW capture in pro mode. b) addition of shutter speed option in pro mode. c) increase in iso range. d) histogram in pro mode.3) Addition of Night mode in camera app.4) HDR support for high resolution of 32mp.That's all for now, I hope Samsung team takes these points into consideration and improve the camera and its algorithms. #camera#a70#photos#improvement#developer #support#suggestion #feedback

30.To save battery i used to turn off auto sync when I'm not using internet.Can we disable the dialogue appear when switching syng on or off.Every time i switch sync on or off i need to press ok.

31.Need to provide adaptive battery mode in s8 for better battery management..It should improve battery life.

32.With the new update of s10 series the night mode has became better now pictures taken with it have a good amount of detail at medium light conditions, that's a really good thing I've noticed

33.May security update which better night mode, more secure options is out. Download the same and enjoy the new updated night mode

34.Finally we have update for note 9 after a gap of 2 months. Samsung have skipped April security patch and have directly updated it to May security patch. We have camera improvements update as well.

35.As u know the A50 has a F1.7 aperture which is good for taking low light photos but needs improvements. Please make low light enhancements

36.As u know the A50 has a F1.7 aperture which is good for taking low light photos but needs improvements. Please make low light enhancements

37.I have noticed following changes after installing May Update on my galaxy s9- Toggle to turn off/on for manual rotation in navigation bar- Touch sound changed to 'Tone'- Turning on mobile data shows LTE+ instead of LTE- Regarding battery life, improvements will only be noticable after 2-3 days (its been only 5 hours since I installed this update)

38.Hello All,I have done all the things suggested by Samsung to improve the day to day battery life but it hardly goes a day.I would urge Samsung that we are ready to pay extra money but please increase the existing battery from 3500 to 4500 atleast.It drains like water.

39.I think Samsung should have a section for Health related videos so that people can be educated about the wellness of their health. Do share your views on this?

40. Hello Samsung I have a concept idea about a possible One UI 1.2 version for current version of Android and for all devices running One UI including Samsung Galaxy A50:  - Samsung Beta Club with other users to get Beta Preview Builds of what ………… And for Samsung Beta Club app Sugget.....the process of next Android/One UI version.





General-
1. Hi Guys    I am looking to add people on my Samsung Health Profile :)    My email address if anyone wants to add me 

2. Their update on the 15th of May rendered the expensive clear view case useless for many of us. Samsung support suggest basically resetting the phone to factory settings - but wouldn't that just mean the same faulty update would be pushed to the phone again?    Is it not better if they actually come out with a fix to address the disasterous update of May…. Thanks
