"151","I have been using the Gear S3 for two years and have always been satisfied, until now. Since I got this update with OneUI, the battery performance is not bad, it is a nightmare. I usually used the watch like this: Always On display, no wrist movement activation, GPS, Notifications of WhatsApp and other Apps. As the display was always one of the biggest power consumers, I disabled the display wakeup by wrist movement and so I only had a dimm glowing watch face. This setup made more than two days or up to 56 hours! So after the update with the same setup and same usage and behavior I can get 12 or more or less. The strange thing is that the watch is able to burn 25 % in two hours for nothing. You just have this watch at your wrist and at lunch the battery is dead. I hope you are able to look into it, because reading something of battery optimization in changelog made me laugh. Otherwise I hope that I am able to downgrade my watch, because for now it feels like a cheap copy from China with poor battery life. Feedback or questions are welcome.Update Version"

Consequently, S10 users have little recourse but to experiment with the numerous third-party full-featured file transfer solutions. There is no clear way of telling which of these are bona fide or not. They also tend to be over priced, costing $40/£40 for a license to access their complete features on average.

"338","These suggestions and ideas are for a possible One UI 2.0 version for all Samsung devices running Android 9 Pie: - One UI 1.1 Update with latest features and improvements - Kernel Updates and Improvements - Battery Life improvements to fix any battery fast drain problems and add new optimizations and fixes - Privacy Guard Feature - Framework Improvements - A new type of Software Updates which doesn't focus only on Security Updates but on the all System itself - Wi-Fi improvements and new features - Call Recording feature - Screen Capture feature - Advanced Security - A new EROFS file system (also known as ""Extendable Read-Only File System""), which helps to improve the smoothness of all Samsung Smartphones. It claims that the random read speed is 20% higher than the EXT4 file system, up to 63.3MB/s, to ensure that the system is not only fluid but also saves space. Plus, the read-only memory design isolates outside interference for added security in your system files. - API Improvements - Performance Improvements - GPU Turbo which increases gaming performance and battery - Battery Repair & Optimization tools - DNS Protector Feature which adds extra protection and security to your network - Better Updates and Support - Digital Wellbeing and Bixby Voice/Routine features - Project Mainline Support - Night Mode Improvements - Put Samsung Galaxy A6+ (2018) to Monthly Security List because having A5 (2017) and not A6+ (2018) is not fair, it's disappointing. - Software Redesign (Icons, UI) -> make them more colorful and realistic (more on incons) - Critical and Important system fixes - ART Runtime Improvements I expect that Software Updates should not include only Security fixes and improvements, but One UI improvements, new features and bugfixes. I am disappointed how Samsung manages its Software Updates.It's time for them to give more support and priority to A6+ (2018) because like me, everyone wants to get faster and latest updates to include new features and everything I mentioned above. Is Project Treble used by Samsung?All Samsung devices should be equal, because all costs money, not only flagships are important. And A6+ (2018) should get One UI 1.1 update in the future because it's not fair.Also Samsung should give A6+ (2018) ""2019 Software Updates"" with features, updates and improvements from 2019 A models.What I seen so disappointing is that Samsung give its devices new features,improvements and major changes only when a new Android version is released. Why do that? Can't you just keep working on One UI on the current Android version ? it would be better if Samsung is going to change their Software Policy and give Updates Support for 4 years. Not everyone may agree with me but that's the best I want from Samsung and I hope I will see these in the nearest future."

But when i wanted to shrink it (for example to the original ""pre-set"" lenght) it was not allowed.

My phone fits a single SIM only (not dual). I kept getting prompted to update the android software on the phone though so went through with it - twice. I don't recall what version of android I was on before but I am now on version 9 - Pie. The first installation worked ok (presumbaly upgraded to Oreo), but after the latest one, my SIM isn't recognised, none of the mobile network options are available in Settings and it keeps saying ""insert SIM"". There is nothing wrong with the SIM as it still works on my old phone. Also the IMEI numbers have disappeared from About Phone. Pressing *#06# in the keypad, which should also reveal them, keeps making the phone freeze. After googling - I have literally tried everything under the sun- rebooted, re-inserted, cleaned the SIM, reset connections, rebooted and wiped cache partition, I even did a factory reset - but that did nothing - the exact same problem persists. (The factory reset retains the same android version 9). One thing I noticed was when I boot in recovery mode (to wipe cahe partition) I see the following message at the bottom of the screen:#fail to open recovery_cause (No such file or directory) ##report recovery cause is [unknown] #Support single-skuFile-Based OTASupported API: 3e: unknown volume for path [/ odm]e: unknown volume for path [/ vendor] # MANUAL MODE v1.0.0#remove failed dir ‘/system/carrier/ATT/priv-app/AttIqi_ATT’ (No such file or directory)E: [libfs_mgr] is_dt_compatible (): firmware info was not valid : '/ proc / device-tree / firmware / android / compatible': No such file or directory Does this mean anything relevant to the SIM and does anyone know how to fix this?

"422","What I didn't expect, though, is that by upgrading to Android Pie + One UI, you lose a ton of stuff as well.Starting off with the terrible, terrible multitasking. Why would you have only one app on the multitasking screen at a time? Why don't you see the icon for dual window anymore? It is so painful to navigate through that screen when it was so well-done on previous versions of Android... Is this iPhone or Android?!Another thing I noticed (like everyone) is the lack of an option to hide the navbar.Why are we forced to use either crappy gestures or see the navbar full-time (especially when the icons are terrible, coming back to this later)?!The UI offers an easier way to use that giant screen, sure; you can finally remap the Bixby button natively, sure; the system-wide night mode is very handy, sure, but... C'mon, that phone doesn't feel special anymore.That, and the battery doesn't last as long as it should, so I'm assuming it's because of the new Android.- Camera appWhat's that? A camera app that has a dedicated button to change what camera is used, but not one that allows you to take videos? AR Emojis? Bixby vision?! I mean, I get it Samsung, you're trying to please more the young users, but I'd prefer, y'know... having the choice to see that...Also, the Pro Mode is a huge, HUGE downgrade from my LG G4.There's so few options, I can't take a correct picture (when taking photos is the reason I bought that phone in the first place). And having to search through pages of useless modes doesn't help, when I could get to it in two taps on my G4.- One UI itselfI'm not a big fan of the new default app icons - that's kinda subjective but I feel like they could have been drawn by a kid.I'm NOT a fan at all of the new UI icons - the navbar in particular. It looked futuristic, it looks just bad now. And the fact that you can't make it transparent and hide it natively is such a hassle.I am not using the default Samsung Experience launcher, so I can't really speak about that, but the lockscreen is now terrible - it looks washed out.Apart from that, I haven't much to say - it feels like a regular Android experience to me.TL;DR : I'm rolling back to android 8 and don't recommend upgrading until every problem here has been adressed, but I feel like they will never be and that's a shame."

"449","Based on our fault-free relationship with the old TV (which is still going strong by the way), we felt we shoulldn't have to be pressured into buying an extended warranty as (according to an EU directive), a brand new TV set of any make or model should last a minimum of four years anyway. Anyway I have to say we were very impressed with our first ever Samsung product... right up until this week. Remember, this TV is 15 months old, and just 3 months out of warranty. We switched it on as usual the other day, and were horrified to see that the picture was very dark all over. And when I say very dark, I mean we couldn't make anything out on the Programme Guide at all, and the picture on every channel was exactly the same, left to right and top to bottom. We went back to our local branch of Curry's/PCWorld where we'd bought it from. They offered no help at all of course. In fact the only thing the Sales Assistant could come up with was an obnoxiously smug and rude comment about how we probably should have taken out their extended warranty after all. So if anyone from the Samsung Corpration ever actually reads this comment, rest assured that not only will we not be recommending any Samsung products to friends, family and online associates, but we will make a point of actually steering them away from all Samsung products. Instead choosing to sing the praises of Panasonic and LG based upon our (now) almost 11-year-old TV from Panasonic which is still working perfectly. On a serious note, this is just not fair, it's very poor practice and customer service, and it serves as nothing other than to stamp all over any positive reputation which Samsung continues to try and build in the EU. Samsung should be ashamed!"

"486","I've created an account here to report a bug in the latest SM-T813 (Galaxy Tab S2 VE (2016) 9.7"") firmware build.The relevant build is:Build date: Tue, 22 Jan 2019 11:04:29Security Patch Level: 2019-01-01My particular PDA is: T813XXU2BSA1 (which is most of Europe + Cellular South-USA + Canada) - Android 7.0 The problem also appears to be discussed at:- https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Tablets/Galaxy-Tab-S2-drains-battery-after-recent-update/td-p/12...where it seems to affect the T713 too. The problem started almost immediately after my firmware was updated on 3 April 2019.I have investigated for several weeks now, I have done endless system cache wipes, uninstalled Apps (of which I have few anyway) and even resorted to a factory reset. Switching off auto App update is also irrelevant.None of this solved the problem. The rapid battery drain is fixed for a random short time (minutes to >24hrs) after the cache wipe, but always returns within about a day's usage.I have location/GPS and bluetooth OFF and Wi-Fi ""Always ON"", as before the update. I have been through all the settings checking that relevant things are OFF where necessary. Before, the overnight battery drain would be 2-3% at most, now it is >15%.This is totally unacceptable and ridiculous, it's nearly as bad as having the screen on permanently, and especially and for such a high end tablet as this !!! Switching off Wi-Fi, either directly or flight mode (same thing for me) stops the drain. Setting Wi-Fi to ""off whilst idle"" also mostly solves the problem, but this totally defeats the purpose of notifications, so is not acceptable, especially when it worked fine before. Something has changed... for the worse. Looking at the process battery consumption, it's the Android OS, Android System & Device idle components suddenly consuming power. It seems they are triggered by some unknown event into doing some pointless activity, but related to the Wi-Fi state.The ""before"" and ""after"" screenshots below illustrate the problem perfectly. The steep slope of the graph is screen ON and the flat parts are idle time, including one overnight period. I left the device at 23:29 in a good state (nice stepped graph on left), but the next morning at 09:28 it has burnt 17% battery (long steady slope on right graph). Wi-Fi battery usage is also up a small amount. The (lack of) active usage is indicated by the identical screen %. BTW, do not blame the BBC News App. After the factory reset I ran with no additional Apps installed to check out this factor (rogue Apps) - Problem still occurs. This is software build bug, not a general problem with Android 7.0. I cannot investigate further as I have downgraded to the previous (and properly working) build (T813XXS2BRI1 from Sep/Oct 2018). The firmware upgrade notification nag is vastly preferable to the battery draining. New builds come out at irregular intervals, so I'm hoping sooner rather than later as this is quite serious. Please can some moderator report this to the Samsung developers for urgent attention. Thank you. Otherwise, I like the device and the new build looked good (when not draining the battery!).Looking forward to the next build and fix for this problem..."
