The issue I've noticed that seems to be new due to the update is the sound will get very quiet and almost crackle when I am playing a game on the Nintendo Switch via HDMI. The volume will come back up after a while and continue to fluctuate during play. I have tested another cable and reset audio settings to no avail, but this definitely started immediately after firmware 1251. Has anyone else had this issue? It is pretty significant and I am especially suspicious it is the update bc the power on issue it fixed also had to do with Game mode, and the sound issue I am experiencing now occurs in game mode.

They look like they were designed for kids !  But let's talk about the Always on Display feature !! Since I've had the A5 (2017), I now own a A8 (2018), I've been fond of AOD. It's been even better with all the updates, giving us the possibility to customize it even more.  Wanna know what it looks like know ? Utter and absolute *****.  The hour display I used to find super graceful and elegant has not been spared either.  And whose idea was it to color the small icons under the hour display/clock ??

First of all I want to say that I'm huge fan of Samsung Smartphones. Im not here to troll! In past I had S2,S3,S4,S5,Note 4 and now for almost 3 years now I been used my S7 edge and I love it. Amazing phone! Now, few days ago price for S10 with 2 years contract on the Sweden Comviq operator drooped to 39 Euros with 10Gb net and free calls. I thought: Wow! This is a good deal! It's time for big upgrade. Finally i can replace my S7edge! It's been like ages. Ok,I pull the trigger and order S10 120Gb (white color) and I was super excited about it! Just two days later i received my package, I open it up and my excitement started to go down very, very fast... In short here what I found in less then 30 minutes: S10 can't switch between cameras in video recording 1080P 60fps and 4K 60fps mode. You are stuck with only main camera. S10 don't have PRO mode for video recording. S10 have lower low light and indoors pictures quality compare to my S7 edge and my wife S8. S10 have Power-button way up on the side which make it very hard to use with one hand. S10 on the You-tube App has only 1080p resolution supported while my S7 edge has 1440p S10 has no higher screen brightness when watching videos on you-tube app compare to my S7 edge tested 50% up to 100% brightness."

S10 feels a bit more hollow inside when you knock it with the finger on the back glass compare to my S7 edge. S10 USB C charging port is soldered directly to the motherboard so If you damage it basically you have to replace whole motherboard ( For this last one I seen S10 tare-down video on YouTube) Maybe I forgot anything... Anyway, I got to say that for the price of 1000Euros (in most of the Sweden stores) I found S10 to be very disappointing smartphone. For me personally it feels more like a downgrade from my S7 edge and for sure not a upgrade. What I also found a very frustrating is a fact that not even one ''PRO'' reviewers on YouTube mention any of this on their S10 video reviews!? I simply can not believe it!... So what I did on the end? Sadly, I put my S10 back to the package and I send it back to the Comviq. It seems that I will stay with my S7 edge until Samsung fix these issues on the S10. If not I hope that S11 will be better. Time will tell... P.S. Big thanks to the Comviq Sweden for letting me to return S10 back and roll back my old monthly subscription!"

This brightness Controller works with icc color profile. how do i install it through the Chromium terminal? is there alternatives since Xrandr is no longer supported under Chromium OS? There are some Chromebooks out there with OLED screens. i wonder if there is a way to copy whatever they are using to control the screen!  - The sound card ALC298 is supposed to be supported under Linux. However there is no sound coming through the speakers and there is no solution i found so far.  on this page the driver for the webcam is called &quot;Intel 2D Imaging driver&quot;. is it supported on Linux? The Camera on this device needs these drivers in order to work: Intel Control Logic (Device ID : Intel CSI2 Host Controller (Device ID : PCI\\VEN_8086&DEV_9D32 ) Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2500 (Device ID : PCI\\VEN_8086&DEV_1919 ) I havent found any offical LINUX release but some are working on bringing the drivers to the platform. anyone knows if someone was successful ?  - Sadly i have found no evidence that the SMO8A80 accelerometer is supported or if there is Linux driver for it out there... maybe there is a way around this? The Accelerometer driver is called : SAMSUNG K2HH Accelerometer Driver This GitHub page and This one offer varius Samsung devices drivers. Are they useable ? Can anyone make a useable Linux driver out of them ? The device ID: ACPI\\VEN_SMO&DEV_8A80&SUBSYS_C135144D  With a lot of luck everything else works great on this device and the experience is truly refreshing after having to spend a couple of weeks suffering with windows 10. It would be amazing if you guys can point me in the direction where i can get the last of those shortcomings covered."

In fact, this new display solution, which best reaches all the sides of the frames, incorporates just below the screen all the useful sensors of the Smartphone, including the fingerprint recognition sensor, of which we will talk in details in the next weeks.     Front Camera sensors have been inserted inside the surface of the display, thanks to a proprietary technology that has let to create a hole with a high precision without affecting the functioning of the pixels around it.     Taking the Galaxy S10e aside, which has a 5.8-inch display with a completely flat surface and a FHD+ panel, all the technology used in the Galaxy S10|S10+ (6.1 and 6.4 inches respectively) really works wonders :grinning-face-with-one-large-and-one-small-eye:     In fact we are talking about cutting-edge technical features, including:     - Physical High resolution with 3040x1440 pixel of the panel; - Possibility to display 16 millions of colors; - A proprietary hardware component to optimize image quality performance (mDNIe = mobile Digital Natural Image engine); - HDR10+ certification, the same that is also found on some flagship TVs; - Dynamic Tone Mapping that optimizes the brightness level to make the most hidden details visible; -  Reduction of the 42% blue light; - 100% Color Volume with 0.4 JNCD of accuracy, 1200 nits of peak brightness and contrast ratio 2M:1. What does it mean for you? That you're finding yourself in front of the best panel ever made for a Smartphone, and Display Mate says too! :shocked-face-with-exploding-head:     The beauty of these displays does not stop there: in the settings, you always have the possibility to adjust the screen colors for your device and choose between Vivid or Natural color mode!     With all this you can enjoy spectacular content also provided by third-party services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.     New Galaxy S10 screens provide an inimitable experience in the multimedia sector: what benefits will your use of the Smartphone derive from all this?
